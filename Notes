anytime you start this stuff please start the sunspot server by running 
	
rake sunspot:solr:start


stuff that need a fixing
fix the footer position for all pages
fix the link routes on the nav for events and show
on the events page get the bloody pagination to work
fix the pagination that doesnt like sunspot. use kaminari if need be

fixed stuff and how
fix the crazy switching image sizes (Temporary fix by adding a margin of 1em to the bottom item)
get the links to work with the events title etc(fixed. turns out the links are white in bootstrap mother node. need to change that. by default mine are brown but that will be changed)
fixed the bloody image file from that css but problem is. i dont know where it is located now... so id stay we are safe .. albeit temporarily
the images on the home page need be changed - changed after our app css started working

here is an idea. insted of creating a tag cloud make the cloud populate the list on the industry drop down and thus problem solved. tags as usual are sparated by commas



need styling
include a place to place the tickets from eventsbrite


needs to be added
devise user
user can crud events

stuff that need a doing
User authentication
Event creation form one use
create user dashboard

routing as the lady requires

Dumped for collection stuff


Notes on Following latest design docs
choice of font family and color is thoroughly questionable. stuff looks horrible therefore i am inline styling them on the page so that if need be i just remove their classes and they revert to defaults
event [age background: white or white smoke. for the client prefered color, horrible
